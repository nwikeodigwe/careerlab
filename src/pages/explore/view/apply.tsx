        When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You
        should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you
        back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are
        scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to
        work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always
        verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an
        imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and
        see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work
        are rampant, be careful! Read more to avoid scams. When clicking on the
        button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job
        application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts
        no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon
        information on there (external sites) or here.
